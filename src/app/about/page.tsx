      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Three friends, Harley (the angry old atheist), <a href="/about/mcp">Tony (aka MCP)</a>, and Fonso, 
        get together to randomly rant about movies and all things pop culture. From reviewing the latest releases to 
        diving into cult classics, nothing is off-limits. Expect irreverent humor, passionate opinions, and plenty of 
        tangents as they navigate the world of film, often disagreeing along the way. With a healthy dose of listener 
        interaction and running gags, "The Bad Boys Podcast" offers a unique and unfiltered take on movies, guaranteed
        to spark debate and entertain.</p>
